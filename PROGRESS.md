# Project to add OKHSL to Aseprite

The goal of this project is to learn from the ground up how C++ create applications and how I can add a new feature to customise my own version of Aseprite to add a very useful color space that places emphasis on values and finding corresponding hue and saturation which removes a key weakness of mine.

## Useful resources:

- <https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker> - the write up that introduced to the concept to me and it has the code required to convert to OKHSL values
- <https://github.com/behreajj/AsepriteOkHsl> - an attempt I found when researching if the project has already been done - approach is to introduce a script written in Lua to offer a way to apply OKHSL. But this way proves to be a hack that requires quite a bit of muscle around.

## Project Progress Tracking

- 20/01/2024: introduced to OKHSL and the idea was conceptualised
